# Code of Conduct

Rules for being part of this webring.

Your Wildcat!/WINServer site must NOT contain anything that depicts any illegal activities, including but not limited to, drugs, drug use, warez, etc. It also must NOT contain nudity available on your public pages. We are not the police, nor will we police your system, but we want to keep the public pages where you have the webring code, clean and family friendly. If after you have signed up, we find your site no longer meets these standards, your system will be deleted from the webring without recourse.
